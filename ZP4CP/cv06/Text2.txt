
In 2011, the new C++ standard was finished. 

Many new features were added around this time, the most notable of which are virtual functions, function overloading, 
references with the & symbol, the const keyword, and single-line comments using two forward slashes. 

Some of the new features included regular expression support, 
a comprehensive randomization library, a new C++ time library, atomics support, a standard threading library , a new for loop 
          syntax providing functionality similar to foreach loops in certain other languages, 
the auto keyword, new unordered set and map container classes, and better support for unions and array-initialization 
lists.

The ++ operator in the C language is an operator for incrementing a variable.
